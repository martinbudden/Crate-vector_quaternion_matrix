# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

Releases of the form `0.1.n` do not adhere to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html),
that is each release may contain incompatible API changes.

Once the API has stabilized this project will adopt semantic versioning, the first release to do so will be `0.2.0`.
